         <h2>Story about 0 and 1</h2>
         <p>In this project, Yilin, my classmate, and I were assigned to one group to create a biography inspired by each other. I needed her information to begin with my project, so I talked with her and asked her some prepared questions. Then I know some personal details about her, such as where she came from and how many people are in her family. She enjoys diving, reading, taking and traveling. In her spare time, she also likes organizing home and going to Star Market, and she also likes taking photograph and traveling.</p>
         <br>
         <p>After having a better understanding of each other, I notice that our names have similar meanings because they are related to water. Chinese people always assign special meanings to children’s names. Take Yilin as an example, her name means good rain because her mother wishes her to grow up as a happy and free girl, just like a good rain. It is interesting that there might exist some relationship between her name and her hobby of diving. The motion of diving is as the same as the movement of rain because both of them are vertical.And she is a deep thinking girl. there is too much coincidence in her name. Therefore, I decided to use her name as an inspiration.
         </p>
         <br>
         <P>More specifically, her name consists of two parts, Yi and Lin. Yi is pronounced as [i:] in Mandarin Chinese. This pronunciation is as the same as how Chinese people pronounce the number — 1. And Lin sounds like [liŋ](0) in Mandarin by phonetic pronunciation.Using the pattern as a start, I began to write a story of numbers “1” and “0”. The pattern of “1” “0” combines together like rain, so the story is about rain. Our project contains a print job and a digital output. I try to use my design to describe the raindrops movement.After a talk with my professor about my rough idea, he suggests I could add some deep thinking about my project, making them more meaningful. I realize the raining things can also go well with numbers. “1 and “0 is the origin of our world. Then my story is about the rain and the numbers.</P>
