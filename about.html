            <h2>About</h2>
            <p>My name is Xiqiao Chen, Iâ€™m a visual designer currently based in Boston, I focus on Branding, Typography, Editorial, Exhibition and Web Design. I always interested in constructing visual communication logic and provide effective solutions. I collaborate with independent curator on exhibition design for galleries like Inside-out Art Museum, Art Link Art, Oooit art and Beijing Guoyi gallery. I also work with clients like Oriental Keyart, SDX Joint Publishing Company and Culture and Art Publishing House.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>I will continue my designer career and establish my own studio, concentrating on exhibition planning and exhibition material design. I believe the replacement of paper media with digital media will ease the environmental pressure. Moreover, people tend to interact with the digital media. With the graphic designer experience and the graduate study, I become acquainted with the domestic graphic design condition. To open my own studio, I still need to improve my management and comprehensive abilities.</p>
